# Sim's MHWI Build Search Tool

**CURRENT A WORK IN PROGRESS.** I'm developing this to aid in build optimization for the game Monster Hunter World Iceborne!

The current goal is to make a fully-functional EFR optimizer for GS and SnS. I want this script to automatically create entire builds with as little manual tweaking as possible (except for updating the database, or stating build constraints).

Afterwards, I'll expand to also consider elemental/status, and then other weapons (and their weird and wonderful mechanics/oddities that will probably drive me crazy to try to implement).
